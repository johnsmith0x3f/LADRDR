\section{Span and Linear Independence}

\begin{exercise}{10}
	Suppose \( v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m} \) is linearly independent in \( V \) and \( w \in V \). Prove that if \( v_{1} + w, \ldots, v_{m} + w \) is linearly dependent, then \( w \in \spanspace(v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}) \).
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
	If \( v_{1} + w, \ldots, v_{m} + w \) is linearly dependent, then there exists \( a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m} \), not all \( 0 \), such that
	\begin{align*}
		a_{1}(v_{1} + w) + \cdots + a_{m}(v_{m} + w) &= 0, \\
		            a_{1}v_{1} + \cdots + a_{m}v_{m} &= -(a_{1} + \cdots + a_{m})w.
	\end{align*}
	Since \( v_{1} + w, \ldots, v_{m} + w \) is linearly dependent, \( a_{1} + \cdots + a_{m} \neq 0 \), and hence
	\[
		w = \frac{-a_{1}}{a_{1} + \cdots + a_{m}}v_{1} + \cdots + \frac{-a_{m}}{a_{1} + \cdots + a_{m}}v_{m} \in \spanspace(v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}),
	\]
	as desired.
\end{proof}

\section{Bases}

\begin{exercise}{8}
	Suppose \( U \) and \( W \) are subspaces of \( V \) such that \( V = U \oplus W \). Suppose also that \( u_{1}, \ldots, u_{m} \) is a basis of \( U \) and \( w_{1}, \ldots, w_{n} \) is a basis of \( W \). Prove that
	\[
		u_{1}, \ldots, u_{m}, w_{1}, \ldots, w_{n}
	\]
	is a basis of \( V \).
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
	Consider an arbitary \( v \in V \). Since \( V = U \oplus W \), there are unique vectors \( u \in U \) and \( w \in W \) such that \( v = u + w \). Hence there are unique scalars \( a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m}, b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n} \) such that
	\[
		v = u + w = a_{1}u_{1} + \cdots + a_{m}u_{m} + b_{1}w_{1} + \cdots + b_{n}w_{n},
	\]
	which, by 2.29, implies that \( u_{1}, \ldots, u_{m}, w_{1}, \ldots, w_{n} \) is a basis of \( V \).
\end{proof}

\section{Dimension}

\begin{exercise}{17}
	You might guess, by analogy with the formula for the number of elements in the union of three subsets of a finite set, that if \( U_{1}, U_{2}, U_{3} \) are subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space, then
	\begin{align*}
		\dim(U_{1} + U_{2} + U_{3}) =& \dim{U_{1}} + \dim{U_{2}} + \dim{U_{3}} \\
		                             &- \dim(U_{1} \cap U_{2}) - \dim(U_{2} \cap U_{3}) - \dim(U_{3} \cap U_{1}) \\
																 &+ \dim(U_{1} \cap U_{2} \cap U_{3}).
	\end{align*}
	Prove this or give a counterexample.
\end{exercise}
