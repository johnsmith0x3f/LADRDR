\section{Subspaces}

\begin{exercise}{12}
	Prove that the union of two subspaces of \( V \) is a subspace of \( V \) if
	and only if one of the subspaces is contained in the other.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose \( U \) and \( W \) are subspaces of \( V \), such that \( U \cup W \)
	is also a subspace and neither is contained in the other.
	In other words, \( U \not\subset W \) and \( W \not\subset U \).
	Let \( u \in U - W \) and \( w \in W - U \).
	Since \( U \cup W \) is a subspace of \( V \), we have \( u + w \in U \cup W \).
	However,
	\begin{align*}
		u + w \in U &\Rightarrow w = (u + w) - u \in U, \\
		u + w \in W &\Rightarrow u = (u + w) - w \in W,
	\end{align*}
	which implies that \( u + w \) is in neither \( U \) nor \( W \), a contradiction.
\end{proof}
